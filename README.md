# Pseudo-Skeleton-Decomposition-of-Tensors

An attempt to code the Pseudo Skeleton Decomposition Algorithm for Tensor Approximation/Decomposition

pseudoSkeletonDecomp.m - Actual implementation of Algorithm for equidimensional two-dimensional tensor

pseudoInverse.m - To find the Pseudo Inverse of the given Matrix and also gives the error from actual function 

maxvol2.m - Computes the sub matrix of a given one using maximum subvolume algorithm (File given by Prof. Kishore Kumar)
